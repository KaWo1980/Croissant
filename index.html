      To celebrate National Croissant Day, we’re taking a deep dive into the
      history of the croissant, complete with input from ICE’s Director of
      Pastry Research & Development, Chef Jürgen David. Across various accounts
      of croissant history, most sources agree that it originates from Austria
      as the kipferl. Made from a yeasted wheat dough, the kipferl is a baked
      bread roll common in Central Europe. Records state that the kipferl has
      been around as early as the 13th century, but many believe it may be even
      older. Popular myths attribute its invention as a celebration of the
      Ottoman Empire’s defeat in the Battle of Vienna; the crescent shape
      represented the moon on the Ottoman flag. “These stories are almost
      certainly untrue,” Austrian native Chef Jürgen says. Regardless of the
      kipferl’s origins, it would migrate to France later in the 19th century.
      In another common legend, Marie Antoinette is said to have introduced the
      kipferl to French court, homesick for foods from Austria. While it’s a
      romantic story, there are no historical records to back up this retelling.
      The earliest recorded introduction of the kipferl to France occurred in
      1839, when Austrian artillery officer August Zang founded a Viennese
      bakery in Paris. Parisians fell in love with the kipferl (and with
      Viennese baking as a whole), and imitated the bread in their own shops.
      The name "croissant" also began appearing in historical record, referring
      to the crescent shape of the bread. In 1915, Sylvain Claudius Goy recorded
      the first-known French version of the croissant recipe. Instead of brioche
      dough, as August Zang used, Goy transformed the recipe to use a laminated
      yeast dough. Lamination involves folding butter and dough to create thin,
      flaky layers of pastry. And thus, the iconic French pastry we know and
      love today was born.
